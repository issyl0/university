French Cinema during the Occupation.
------------------------------------

- Dark period.
- Traumas.
- 1940-1944.

3 Sept. 1939:     Declaration of War.
22 Jun. 1940:     Armistice. Defeated France is divided into two.
10-11 Jul. 1940:  Marshal Pétain is named head of State (Vichy).
3 Oct. 1940:      "Jew status".
6 Jun. 1944:      Anglo-American troops landed in Normandy.
25 Aug. 1944:     Liberation of Paris.
8 May 1945:       Armistice.

Films made then never showed war-torn France. No film shows France
being Occupied. Censorship meant that filmmakers could talk about it
after it happened, but not during.

COIC (Comité d'Organisation de l'Industrie Cinématographique):
  - Professional card: in '49, you had not to be a Jew. You had to
                       have enough financial resources. You couldn't
                       be a Jew in the film industry in France even
                       before the Germans asked for it. Strong
                       anti-semitism, and narrow viewpoints in cinema,
                       with lots of producers overlooked.
  - Records of exhibition sector: the Germans had control over who saw
                                  what and where.
  - End of double programme (two tickets for two films, because they
    were made in parts): feature films and documentaries.
  - Advance to producers financed by National Credit.
  - Creation of IDHEC: State film school.

Continental Film:
  - Created in November 1940.
  - Alfred GREVEN.
  - Produced 30 out of the 220 films produced during the Occupation.
  - Special connections, so no problems producing films.
  - How did they export films for different languages? Film the same
    film with different casts (French/German) at the same time with
    the same set.
  - Never produced propaganda films.
  - All films other than French and German were banned.
  - People went to the cinema to escape, hide, have fun, and it was
    somewhere warm to go and feel safe. Films provided happiness,
    dreams and romance in dark times.

Marcel Carné.
Henri-Georges Clouzot.

Censorship: anything that didn't show France as virtuous was banned.
  PARADOX: Continental Films was a German company, it didn't have to
           submit its films to Vichy to check for censorship.

Films made a lot of money. Cinema was healthy. No American films, so
French boomed. Salaries small. Not a lot of producers once you
discounted the Jews and foreigners, so the ones in business were good.
Golden Age?

LE CORBEAU:

Characters?
  - Doctor. Authoritative. Impersonal. Doesn't like children, but
    lives in a school. No compassion. Sticks to rules, doesn't care
    about saving lives.
  - Miserable woman is a nurse. Steals morphine? Hates number 13.
  - The social worker in the hospital - well-intentioned, apart from
    with the doctor. Married to the psychiatrist?
  - "Ill" woman who seems to want attention (attemps to seduce the
    doctor). Decadent. In bed, not working. Painting her toenails.
  - Bloke in hospital with cancer, cutting his finger with the razor,
    in bed 13. Later kills himself.
  - Young girl playing with a ball, but listening to conversations.
    Aware of everything. Peeks through the keyhole to the doctor.
Topics?
  - Adultery.
  - Secrecy.
  - Honesty.
  - Differences in social class?
  - Gender roles. Stereotypes. Women doing menial tasks. Male doctors.
Atmosphere?
  - Black and white, so quite grey overall - indecision, mixed up.
    However, very dark and very light - darkness and sunlight - what
    is a lie (black) and what is true (white)? There is no truth?
    Depends where the light is shining at the time.
  - Bad luck: number 13 on the bed, baby dying[1].
  - Suspense. Who did what? Did they really? Who is sending the
    letters?
Why is it controversial?
  - It's to do with adultery.
  - Differences in social class?
  - [1] Does the doctor kill the baby because he doesn't like children?
    There's blood on his hands and he saved mothers rather than babies
    for the third time in six weeks? Maybe he doesn't like girl babies.
    He says to the grandmother that her son should try again "if she
    wants a grandson".
  - "Une petite ville... ici ou ailleurs": it could be anywhere, still
                                           has a relevance to everyday
                                           life. Not related to a
                                           particular event (such as
                                           the War). Timeless.

It is too soon for the Raven to be the nurse - it's not the end of the
film - but people are accusing her and rallying to imprison her. She
is alone running through the streets, with the sound of the crowd and
the sound of the church bells. Is this noise in her head, or in real
life?

The doctor talks about "a burden". An explanation for his distance
from and lack of emotion towards everyone?

The film was seen as anti-French, and maybe this was one of the
reasons why it was banned? Adultery shows French people lacking good
morals, which was important for the French to NOT show as it was
negative. It was banned by the Liberation from 1944 to 1947.

=====================================================

New Wave
--------

- Films are professional, but low-budget.
- Not always fully scripted. Full improvisation of the films is a myth, though.
- Cinéma verité. Truthful. Real buildings and people, not on a pre-made set.
- The director is able to make their own films, about [personal] subjects. If
  they don't write it entirely, they are always involved. The script is not
  pre-made for him to produce.
- New camerawork, shots.
- New Wave was a movement in 1960s France.
- New and unknown young actors. Films with very personal themes. The public was
  shocked. All about young people, with their new ideas and moving on from the
  War.

New Wave: 1949--1968, more precisely 1958--1962 when a lot of films were being
made by new directors. « Nouvelle Vague » comes from L'Express magazine.

Political context:
  - Beginning of the 5th Republic - Charles de Gaulle.
  - Algerian War, de-conolisation, the end of the French empire.

157 films made by 9 directors previous to the New Age movement. 160 new film
makers made their first film once the New Wave had pushed those conventions out.

François Truffaut.
André Bazin - Cahiers du Cinéma (1951).
Henri Langlois.

Direct sound: the sound is recorded at the same time as the pictures.
              400 Blows was one of the first films to do that.

400 Coups:
  - The scene with the psychiatrist is typically French -- very honest, no
    hesitation, no spinning the truth to suit himself -- he gave up lying.
  - Mother & boy: no love in the mother's eyes.
  - The ending is unconventional in that the boy runs away and we don't know
    what happens to him. The camera shot never moves, we never see his eyes or
    feet. Him running away emphasizes his freedom and new life -- he has
    possibly never seen the sea before until that time.

================================

Revolution.
-----------

Images of violent uprising have occurred throughout French cinema (war: Algerian
War => La Bataille d'Alger, L'Armée des Ombres...).

1968 - uprisings, anti-capitalist protestors (workers and students). Film: La
Chinoise (1967) - anticipatory filmmaking of the uprising.

Political struggle has become fragmented - people have got upset about their own
issues (eg LGBT people about LGBT-related things), but not about others' issues
in a big, common way.

Godard: "Revolution cannot be split up from cinema".
        « Ce n'est pas une image juste, c'est juste une image. »
          - Overthrowing the tyranny of the image, making us realise that
            mindlessly swallowing romantic films or adverts etc. are bad and
            rendering us ignorant and capitalist.

Film criticism: A star (famous) can draw a crowd based on themselves - their
                baggage, their message. An actor (not famous) can draw a crowd
                based on their acting - their portrayal of characters.

Tout Va Bien:
  - A couple are in a long-term relationship and end up involved in a strike for
    some workers - a revolutionary struggle.
  - The opening ten minutes are aesthetically revolutionary:
    - The filmmakers themselves don't know what the film is going to be about -
      they throw around ideas.
    - The film begins with the same speech as "Le Mépris" - "do you love me?";
      "I love your eyes, etc". (She also says "I love your balls", which is a
      feminist reversal of the objectification of women - she is allowed to
      objectify the man, as well.)
    - He self-references and questions the viewer by trying to plan out his film
      while he's making it, asking why we actually want to watch a standard
      romance film?
  - Inter-class relationships: people don't generally communicate between
    classes, or have relationships middle class => lower class.
  - Focusing on the reality of what's explained: the main (bourgeois) characters
    are inserted into the actual film to enable empathy with the workers. We
    watch documentaries as "other" people, but when we watch dramas, we relate
    to the characters. We automatically categorize people and things - but we
    can't really, here, because it mixes them up. Questioning our our comfort
    zones and everyday lives, with unavoidable images of animal carcasses and
    meat in the factory, for example.

White Material:
  - Struggle.
  - Maria loves and respects for the country she lives in and her family.
  - Block between affection and liking.
  - Maria is solipsistic - only able to relate to herself - narcissistic.
  - Very difficult to watch. Child soldiers. Disturbing.
  - Are the children dangerous, or should we take pity on them?
  - The children eat pills and they render them comatose, so there was no
    screaming when they were killed. Did they want to die? Hungry for something,
    but they don't necessarily know what it is.
  - Rifles are used as a metaphor for Maria's life so far - everything backfires
    onto her.
  - The woman pointing the gun with the children seems frightened - she is just
    pointing the gun because she has it, not because she wants to use it. Power.
  - The end of the film is post-racial: black hugs white, white hugs black,
    persecution doesn't exist anymore - they support and comfort each other.

================================

Community.
----------

France and French culture doesn't like the idea that people get
together under a common banner or for a common cause.

La Règle du Jeu.

  - Does a group really exist? Isn't everyone in it together? It was
    felt to be a film that undermined the fabric of French society.
  - Upper/Middle/Lower class characters all given important roles in
    the film, but shows how they're split. Class division brings
    catastrophe. Within the married couples or the adulterous couples
    there's no harmony. Betrayal, disloyalty, distrust, treachery
    exist always.

  - An assault on French society.

  - The fox hunt is a large part of the film, takes up a long time.
  - Brings home slaughter of animals and death of animals, and veiled
    antisemitic references, and hatred.

  - One of the central characters is obsessed with dolls, robots,
    things that are dead inside but still can move. To some extent,
    the characters themselves are dead - lacking empathy, not sure why
    they're doing what they're doing.

  - Camerawork is revolutionary: three layers of people, all visible,
    behind each other - layers of complexity of society.
  - It is a funny film as much as a repulsive film.

  - Characters are very shrill. This is an attempt to reflect society
    on the brink of something big.

  - Bear costume: he can't get out of it, and he's trapped in a dead
    skin. The guy isn't taken seriously. Nightmarish scenario in which
    he loses friends and is no longer human - could he be mistaken for
    a bear and shot?

  - At the end, there's a sequence from the play being performed about
    Jews and people dressed as them. Bestialisation, dehumanisation of
    people - is this a party or a social commentary?

  - « Danse macarbre » - the characters in the play and the animal skin
    play dead people (skeletons) - are they preparing for their own
    death, or dead inside?

  - Switch of allegiance - insincere because sincerity seems to be a
    bad quality.

Conte de Noël.

  - Bone marrow transplant. Death. Least favourite child is the only
    compatible donor.

  - Gratuitous exclamation mark in the subtitle - irony? What does it
    mean? Gravestone background, "Christmas tale", but why is
    "Roubaix" (the town the film was set in) finished with an
    exclamation mark?

  - Parents end up vampirising their children - taking their
    children's blood away from them. Parents feel their children owe
    them something, as in all of Desplechin's films.
    This is the idea that you are only born to help someone else in
    life.

  - Poisonous and unspeakable group collaboration. The group works
    with coldness, a lack of empathy, leukemia, destruction of lives
    from the start. The family go along with banishing Henri and don't
    let him into the house again. His sibling banished her, though, so
    there's a reversal of parent/child relationships.

  - Elisabeth refers to herself as the dead one, when talking to her
    psychiatrist, because she can't name the one who is dead - it's
    not Joseph.

  - The conversations are cold. The viewers are forced to process the
    emotions that the characters themselves cannot. The family is not
    empathic at all. Some scenes make no sense - are they dreams?

  - There is no mourning. The death at the beginning is not mourned.
    The characters cannot register emotion in a "normal" way, and the
    film is disorientatingly blank in terms of depth. Rage, weirdness,
    hallucinations are portrayed as alternatives to this blankness,
    such as the schizophrenic boy.

  - Parallels with the other film: a play within a film (but where
    does it end?), people dressed up, social commentary dressed up as
    comical.

  - Violent language used by Henri at the dinner table, and they
    laugh. This avoids emotionally responding because they are shallow
    and don't want to gratify him.

  - There is a disassociation between the visual and the aural - if
    you watch and don't understand, it is a very different film
    (funny) compared to if you understand the words (traumatic).

Documentary.
------------

Être et Avoir.

  Press review exercise:

1. When was the article written in relation to the original release
   of the film?

    November 2004, two years after the release.

2. Where was it published?

    Sight and Sound film review magazine, number 11.

3. Who was the author?

    The editor of the film review magazine.

4. What type of article is it?

    It is an editorial in a film review magazine.

5. What type of information do you learn from reading the article?

    The teacher in the film was trying to get £137 000 from the
    production company, but they declined because he agreed to no
    compensation when he agreed to let them in, and he wasn't an actor.

6. Does the article contain any new ideas about the film?

    The article does not really give a review of the film, more of a
    review of its politics and that it is more of a performance than
    a documentary. Do documentaries always have to be completely true
    to life, or is there some artistic license for acting?

7. How can this article help you to think more critically about the film?

    Makes us think whether it's a performance or acting, or true to life.
    Does the documentary and the classroom habitat become a performance on
    the teacher's part, and therefore make him invent artificial constructs
    for the viewer's pleasure, making him an actor?

Trauma.
-------

Trauma (physical): "an event in the subject's life defined by its
intensity, by the subject's incapacity to respond adequately to it,
and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about."

Trauma caused by "environmental catastrophe":
  - Sexual assault.
  - Unforeseeable fright or humiliation.
  - War, displacement.
  - Unbearable neglect.
  - "Cumulative trauma" -- Masud Khan.

Characters in these films (Hiroshima Mon Amour and Caché) have had
their protective coating ripped away.

Trauma provokes an uncanny combination of exposure and concealment.

Trauma can cause blankness and dissociation.

French film tries to explore, reveal and work with trauma:
  - Confronting the shock or catastrophe head on. The unshowable.
    Some of the most shocking films are French.

All of the best French films create links between dissociated parts,
and bring deadness back to life.

Hidden: 'resurrection' through violent revelation. The characters are
        violently reminded with images to wake up to their pasts.

================================

Stigma.
-------

If the films were realistic, it would be too horrifying to watch.
Traumatic films 'flash'; stigma is *personal*.

Films like these help us to walk a line between every day occurrences
and horrible things. They help us to rediscover and re-engage with our
feelings.

Pan's Labyrinth.

Hiroshima mon Amour - 1959. Illicit relationships, "vilified ghoul".
Central character's stigmatisation and traumatisation. "She leaves the
realm of humanity" - scratches the wall with her fingers like an
animal in the cage, without realising. Her stigmatised imagery means
she's remembering the way she was treated after her illicit
relationship with a German man in the War (shaved head - "les
tondues"), and relates it to the similar imagery of the liberation of
concentration camps (also shaved heads). Dehumanisation. The people
who carry the guilt of community are treated and stigmatised in their
own way. She becomes a mad, grotesque, evil monster, which she
affirms.

Les Yeux sans Visage - 1960. Christiane is "buried alive". She is
hidden from the world because she loses her face and becomes socially
dead. She is kept imprisoned where she is neither alive nor dead,
because she cannot live because she is not pretty. She is only friends
with animals. She has lost her confidence and social approachability,
and her face and therefore her status. She is less than human.

She has no power within her life. Her father takes over and imprisons
her, to operate on and "fix" whenever he wants. She only talks to
animals - the dogs. She does not emotionally interact with anyone
else. She wears a mask, hence the title - only her eyes are visible.

Mad scientist and his daughter.
Man who can't think about the consequences of his own actions, he
can't face up to what he's done. He sidesteps the guilt and problems,
and enacts more violence (the operations, the imprisonment) on her to
try and solve the problem.

Psychoanalytic concept of projection.

She seems trapped by the absence of a face, among lots of other
things. Her stigma isn't that marks her our knowingly, but the thing
that distinguishes her from others doesn't exist (the face).
