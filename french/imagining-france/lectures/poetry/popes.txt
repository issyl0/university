During Du Bellay’s stay in Rome, there was upheaval in the Vatican due to a
succession of three different Popes. Pope Julius III, who had held office since
1550, led a riotous life of pleasure and feasting. He reintroduced the carnival
and organised bull races near St Peter’s Basilica; he fell in love with a
seventeen-year-old monkey trainer, persuaded his brother to adopt the lad, then
made the urchin a cardinal. Julius III died in March 1555. The pious, upright
Marcellus II who succeeded him unfortunately lasted only 21 days in his papal
position. In May 1555 Paul IV, whose real name was Caraffa, was elected. He soon
became universally detested, but lasted until 1559. At the tender age of 79,
Paul IV began military preparations against the Spanish.

At the same time Italy was engaged in wars. It was the scene of complex
struggles, mainly between France and Spain; the Italian states took part in
these whenever circumstances dictated. Milan was the main bone of contention.
